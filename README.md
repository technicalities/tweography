# [Tweography]

Tweography is a simple single-page Sinatra/JS app for displaying on a Google Map the most recent 100 tweets around your location. There's a live version [on Heroku here](https://limitless-chamber-9916.herokuapp.com/).


## Build instructions

1. Create a Twitter app and fetch all four keys [off of here](apps.twitter.com) and fill in the config.example.rb. The config file included in this repository should be renamed 'config.rb', too.

2. Dependencies
> cd tweography;       $ bundle install

3. Profit:
> ./run.sh
