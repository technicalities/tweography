# [Tweography]

Tweography is a simple single-page Sinatra/JS app for displaying on a Google Map the most recent tweets around your location. There's a temperamental, Firefox-only version [in a slow but free Heroku instance here](https://limitless-chamber-9916.herokuapp.com/).


## Build instructions

1. Create a Twitter app and fetch all four keys [off of here](https://apps.twitter.com) and fill in the config.example.rb. The config file included in this repository should be renamed 'config.rb', too.

2. Dependencies
> cd tweography;  
> bundle install

3. Profit:
> ./run.sh
